# EventEngine web application
This web application was the result of an assignment for a Web Development paper, run through Massey University.
It is an application for gaining inspiration for event hosting. As a Community Leader for the Girl Gone International Aarhus community,
one important role I play is hosting a monthly event for members to connect and create friendships. Sometimes it can be difficult to think 
of a new, exciting event to plan so I wanted to create an "Event Engine" where event hosts can get inspiration.
