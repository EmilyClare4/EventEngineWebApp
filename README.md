# EventEngine web application
This web application was the result of an assignment for a Web Development paper, run through Massey University.
It is an application for gaining inspiration for event hosting. As a Community Leader for the Girl Gone International Aarhus community,
one important role I play is hosting a monthly event for members to connect and create friendships. Sometimes it can be difficult to think 
of a new, exciting event to plan so I wanted to create an "Event Engine" where event hosts can get inspiration.

## Further development plans:
- Allow user to add, update, delete events
- Deploy on GitHub using Azure Web App (currently experiencing log in issues with Microsoft Azure, hence this not being completed)
- Design - filter and search bar particularly
- Responsiveness - small issues with card heights differing in tablet size
